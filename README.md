# Cryto_Currency_Dashboard_PowerBI

To create a multi-page dashboard for cryptocurrency data in Power BI, here are the steps involved:

Gather Data: Collect the necessary cryptocurrency data from reliable sources. This can include historical price data, transaction information, market trends, or any other relevant data you want to visualize in your dashboard.

1.Import Data: Import the cryptocurrency data into Power BI. You can use various data sources, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, databases, or APIs. Power BI provides multiple options for data import.
2.Design Pages: In the report view, create multiple pages to represent different sections or aspects of your cryptocurrency dashboard. You can add a new page by clicking the "New Page" button in the Power BI service or selecting "Home" -> "New Page" in Power BI Desktop.
3.Arrange Visualizations: On each page, drag and drop visualizations from the Visualizations pane onto the canvas. Choose the appropriate chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, tables) to represent your cryptocurrency data effectively. Configure the visualizations by selecting fields from your imported data.
4.Apply Filters and Slicers: Use filters and slicers to enable interactive data exploration. Filters allow users to select specific criteria or time ranges, while slicers provide an interactive way to slice and dice data on the fly. Add these components to your pages as needed.
5.Create Relationships: If you have multiple data tables or sources, define relationships between them. This ensures that you can perform cross-table analysis and filter data across different visualizations accurately. You can manage relationships in the "Manage Relationships" option under the "Modeling" tab.
6.Monitor and Maintain: Continuously monitor the performance of your dashboard, ensure data refreshes are scheduled appropriately, and make updates or improvements as needed based on user feedback and changing requirements.
7.Dashboard creation:-It is the final step in this with helps of above steps we can used to connects model view

These steps provide a general outline of creating a multi-page cryptocurrency dashboard in Power BI. The specific details and configurations may vary based on your data sources, visualizations, and requirements.
